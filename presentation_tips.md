# Preparing a presentation for a Kaggle meetup

## Choosing a competition

- Normally we choose a competition that has ended
- Learner or playground competitions are possible though
- go to the Kaggle [competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
- Sort by _Latest deadline_ to put the most recent competitons at the top
- scroll down until you find a competition of interest
- check that the competition hasn't already been presented
    - check the [log of past meetups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dmunY2g2Is-S6PlfKVZy_99zbIGvVD-f4Omu_rcXrLo/edit?usp=sharing)
    - check the [pipeline of upcoming meetups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YOVuiNuKMd6A5QCLNnNXCZX7UxiCL4dKv5bOq8K0gmw/edit?usp=sharing)

## Preparing the presentation

- plan to present for **one hour, including Q&A**
- it's good to have some extra, expendable material in case time runs short
- check out [Bruce's blog post](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/08/09/learn-data-science-from-kaggle-competition-meetups/) of presentation tips

## The day before

- post your presentation slides, even if unfinished
    - attendees appreciate it
- does your laptop have a _real_ HDMI output?
    - adapters don't work well
    - if you don't have HDMI, let the organizers know and we'll figure something out

## On the day

- bring a mouse if you've got one
    - you can use the mouse as a pseudo laser pointer
    - works well for the audience, live stream viewers, and video recording
- show up at least half an hour before the start (i.e., 6:00pm)
    - there are always glitches, this gives us time to fix problems
- wear a solid color top
    - yes, we're talking about your fashion choices
    - patterns and stripes cause weird Moir√© patterns in the video
